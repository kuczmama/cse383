     <title>XML is verbose!</title>
     <para>
       While some may consider XML to be very verbose (which it can be), it makes up for
     it with a lot of other useful features.  Mainly it is more readable, and it is also
     highly interoperable.  Due to these facts one can often look past XML being very
       verbose.

       <para>
	 Another reason, you can look past the verbosity of XML, is that it can normally
	 be compressed.  When it is compressed the file size is almost a non-issue.  Plus
	 with computers getting faster and faster these days, with more and more memory,
	 it becomes a whole lot easier to store files that are a little bit bigger, if they
	 are more readable.  Plus, more readable code is more maintainable, so having verbose
	 XML is probably a good thing.
